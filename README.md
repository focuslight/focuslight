# Focuslight

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/focuslight/focuslight.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/focuslight/focuslight)

Focuslight is a lightning Fast Graphing/Visualization tool, built on RRDTool. It is a Ruby clone of [GrowthForecast](http://kazeburo.github.io/GrowthForecast/).

Focuslight is compatible with:
 * stored data files
   * database (sqlite) and graphs (rrdtool)
 * almost all HTTP API requests, except for:
   * `export` support
 * almost all of features, except for:
   * `subtract` support (`gmode`, `stype`, `sllimit`, `sulimit` parameters)

## Prerequisites

RRDTool and its dependencies must be installed before installing Focuslight.

* RHEL/CentOS 6.x
  * Add `epel` repository, then `sudo yum install rrdtool rrdtool-devel`
* Ubuntu
  * `sudo apt-get install rrdtool librrd-dev`
* OSX
  * `brew install rrdtool`

## Installation

Install focuslight with Ruby 2.1 or later. 

### Gem package

Five easy steps on installation with gem and SQLite.

```bash
$ gem install focuslight
$ focuslight new
$ cd focuslight
$ focuslight init # creates database scheme on SQLite
$ focuslight start
```

Then see `http://localhost:5125/`. Refer `Using MySQL` section to use MySQL instead of SQLite. 

### Git repository

Install from git repository. 

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/focuslight/focuslight.git
$ cd focuslight
$ bundle
$ bundle exec focuslight init # creates database scheme on SQLite
$ bundle exec focuslight start
```

Then see `http://localhost:5125/`. Refer `Using MySQL` section to use MySQL instead of SQLite. 

### Using MySQL

Change `DBURL` parameter on .env file to `mysql2` version like `DBURL=mysql2://root:@localhost/focuslight`. 
Also configure the database name, the user name, and the password. See the Configuration section. 

Then, create the database and assign permissions to the user as

```
mysql> CREATE DATABASE focuslight;
mysql> GRANT  CREATE, ALTER, DELETE, INSERT, UPDATE, SELECT \\
  ON focuslight.* TO 'user'\@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY password;
```

After that, follow the same procedure with the SQLite case.

## Configuration

To configure Focuslight, edit the `.env` file in the project root directory.

The default configuration is as follows:

```
DATADIR=./data
PORT=5125
HOST=0.0.0.0
# FRONT_PROXY
# ALLOW_FROM
# 1MIN_METRICS=n
FLOAT_SUPPORT=n # y
DBURL=sqlite://data/gforecast.db
# DBURL=mysql2://root:@localhost/focuslight
# RRDCACHED=n
# MOUNT=/
LOG_PATH=log/application.log
LOG_LEVEL=warn
```

## Switch from GrowthForecast

1. Copy GrowthForecast's `datadir` directory (and its contents) to `./data` (or where you specified)
1. Execute Focuslight

## TODO

* Merge GrowthForecast's commits after Jan 09, 2014
  * api endpoint link label
* RRDCached support
* Front proxies and source address restrictions
* HTTP API mount point support
* Daemonize support
* Add tests, and tests, and more tests

## Incompatible Features

Focuslight has following incompatibilities with GrowthForecast as specifications.

### Subtract

[GrowthForecast](http://kazeburo.github.io/GrowthForecast/index.html) has subtract graph support (gmode=subtract),
but focuslight does not have it because subtract graphs can be created using mode=derive like:

```
curl -d "number=10&mode=derive" http://localhost:5125/api/service/section/graph
```

As a demo, you may run following shell codes.
The number is incremental, but derive graph shows you the difference as a graph, which results in 1 in this demo.

```
number=1
while true; do
  curl -d "number=${number}&mode=derive" http://localhost:5125/api/service/section/graph
  number=$((number+1))
  sleep 60
done
```

In addition, because focuslight does not support subtract graphs, `gmode`, `stype`, `sllimit`, and `sulimit`
parameters on HTTP APIs are not available. In the case of POST (create, edit), they are ignored.
In the case of GET, they are not returned.
